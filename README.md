# Scanner

Part of my Compilers course final project.

Purpose: Development of a Scanner using dynamic definition, Regular Expressions,
and Finite Deterministic Automata implementation.

This project taught me many things:
  - Defensive programming
  - Creating a token-driven system
  - Creating a buffer to hold the input
  - Creating a transition table to recognize variable identifiers, keywords, arthimetic operations,
      strings, integer/floating point literals, and string literals    
  - Memory management
